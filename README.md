## Installation
### Carthage
A simple, decentralized dependency manager for Cocoa, [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is intended
to be the simplest way to add frameworks to your Cocoa application. 

[Install Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage) by downloading the latest stable release

or you can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```
To integrate Swifties into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "boxenjim/Swifties"
```

Please refer to the Carthage [documentation](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios) to build for ios for more specific details
